As natural calamities are inevitable there is no way we can stop it. So thinking of the aftermath of the disaster and that internet might not be available then we are going to build a App which will connect the people during such calamities "FIND ME". 
It will be a peer to peer app. The limitation would be when people are not in vicinity. In such cases we'll use broadcast message. The app will let people in vicinity to get together. It will provide facility for users to video call, messege and estimate the distance between them
